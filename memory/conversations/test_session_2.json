I can't access system-level information or run diagnostic tools myself.\n\nHowever, I can definitely help you in other ways! I could:\n\n1. **Guide you through running Windows built-in diagnostics** - like showing you how to use tools like:\n   - Windows Memory Diagnostic\n   - Performance Monitor\n   - Resource Monitor\n   - System File Checker (sfc /scannow)\n\n2. **Help you check specific things** - If you tell me what issues you're experiencing, I can walk you through troubleshooting steps\n\n3. **Recommend diagnostic tools** - I can suggest reliable third-party tools for checking different aspects of your system\n\n4. **Help interpret results** - If you run diagnostics and share the results with me, I can help you understand what they mean\n\nIs there a specific issue you're experiencing with your PC, or are you just looking for a general health check? Let me know what's going on and I'll do my best to help you figure it out! 🔧"
